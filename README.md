# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This project is a derivative of a cookie clicker-style incremental game!. Players click a remote control to gather “attention units”—and can purchase upgrades that increase their passive generation rate. Each upgrade has its own cost, rate, and visual representation, and buying an upgrade triggers a banner. The game features a dynamic UI with animated buttons, responsive counters, and feedback for player actions. Additionally, the game includes an autoclick feature, which can be toggled on and off, letting the counter increase automatically. The UI dynamically updates to show the current count, available upgrades, and their costs.

The floating +1 functionality was inspired by t4ylo's project: <https://github.com/t4ylo/cmpm-121-25-d1-taylorpearce>

The bounce and brighter-darker effect was inspired by AlphaAdira's project: <https://github.com/AlphaAdira/D1_CMPM121>
